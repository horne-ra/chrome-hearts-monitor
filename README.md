# Chrome Hearts new-product monitor (Railway, always-on)

Watches [chromehearts.com](https://www.chromehearts.com) continuously and posts
to Discord the moment a new product appears — name, price, and direct link.

```
🚨 New Chrome Hearts drop
CH LOGO SOCKS ($255.00)

```

For apparel links that encode size in the product id, alerts include the
inferred size without making any extra requests:

```

SHORT SLEEVE POCKET CREW ($320.00)
Size: Medium (MED)

```

## How it works

Chrome Hearts runs a Salesforce Commerce Cloud (Demandware/SFRA) storefront
behind Cloudflare with a small, fast-rotating web catalog. Live category pages
render product tiles server-side; each tile exposes a `product-metadata` span
(product id, name, price) plus a canonical `/cat/subcat/PID.html` link. Sold-out
or empty categories transparently redirect to the homepage (no tiles), so they
just contribute nothing.

The worker runs forever. Each ~30s sweep:
1. Fetches the homepage + every category in `CATEGORIES` as a gentle, jittered
   trickle of requests (reads like browsing, not a burst — keeps Cloudflare calm).
2. Builds the live product set, keyed by product id (PID).
3. Diffs against the saved snapshot; PIDs never seen before are "new."
4. Infers size from the PID/link when Chrome Hearts encodes one in the SKU.
5. Posts new items to Discord, then saves the snapshot.

Keying on PID means it catches genuinely new items even inside categories that
already had products. The first sweep with no prior snapshot **seeds silently**
(records the catalog, sends nothing), so you never get flooded on boot.

## Deploy on Railway

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Railway -> **New Project -> Deploy from GitHub repo** -> pick this repo.
   Railway auto-detects Python and uses the `Procfile`
   (`worker: python chrome_hearts_monitor.py --loop`). No port/domain needed —
   it's a background worker.
3. **Variables** (Settings -> Variables): add
   - `NOTIFY_METHOD = discord`
   - `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL = <your webhook>`
   - `CH_STATE_FILE = /data/seen_products.json`
4. **Volume** (so state survives restarts — important): add a Volume to the
   service mounted at `/data`. Without it a redeploy wipes the snapshot and the
   monitor re-seeds (harmless, but you lose history; with it, nothing is lost).
5. Deploy. You should get a "monitor online" Discord ping within a minute, then
   alerts as drops land.

> The container is always-on by design (no scale-to-zero) — that's what makes
> sub-minute detection possible. It's a tiny process and costs very little.

## Discord webhook

Discord -> Server Settings -> Integrations -> Webhooks -> New Webhook -> pick a
channel -> Copy Webhook URL -> use it as `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`. The URL itself is
the secret; keep it in Railway Variables, never in the repo. Install the Discord
app and enable that channel's notifications to get pings on your phone.

## Local testing

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env            # fill in DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL
set -a && source .env && set +a

python chrome_hearts_monitor.py --seed             # record catalog, no alerts
python chrome_hearts_monitor.py --once --dry-run   # detect + print, send nothing
python chrome_hearts_monitor.py --once             # one real sweep
python chrome_hearts_monitor.py --loop             # what Railway runs
```

## Tuning (env vars)

| Var | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `CH_POLL_SECONDS` | `30` | target seconds between sweep starts |
| `CH_MAX_INDIVIDUAL` | `8` | more new than this in one sweep -> one summary message |
| `CH_STARTUP_PING` | `1` | send a "monitor online" Discord ping on boot |
| `CH_STATE_FILE` | `seen_products.json` | snapshot path (set to `/data/...` on Railway) |

## Categories

`CATEGORIES` in `chrome_hearts_monitor.py` is the full known slug list — the few
that are usually live plus ~28 valid-but-usually-empty ones that populate when a
drop lands. Each sweep also discovers same-site top-level category links from
the homepage/category HTML and crawls a small capped number of those dynamically,
so a newly linked slug can be checked before it is manually added to the list.

**Known gap:** fine jewelry (rings/necklaces/bracelets) has no working top-level
slug observed live; `/ring`, `/jewelry`, etc. 404. The homepage sweep plus
dynamic link discovery is the safety net for featured/newly linked drops
meanwhile — once a real jewelry drop is caught, read its category from the
product URL and add that slug here.

## Other notification backends

`send_notification()` in `notifier.py` also supports Twilio SMS and carrier
email-to-SMS; set `NOTIFY_METHOD` accordingly with the matching env vars.

This scrapes a public site for personal use — keep the cadence reasonable.
